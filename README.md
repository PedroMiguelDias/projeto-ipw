# projeto-ipw

## Requirements

Node.js => 14.x or greater

Npm => 6.x or greater

Nodemon installed globally.

## Running it locally

Npm comes bundled with Nodejs, as soon as you install Node, the latest version of NPM will also be installed for you.


```
mkdir projeto-ipw (in any location you desire)
cd projeto-ipw
git clone git@github.com:PedroMiguelDias/projeto-ipw.git .
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
```

To execute the app in your browser after everything prior is done.

```
nodemon app.js
```

Open your browser and access localhost:3000

If the output of ``` nodemon app.js ``` gives you a different port, use that port instead of the default, which is 3000.
